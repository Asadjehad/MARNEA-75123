Naji AlDahoudi is a Professor of Physics & Materials Sciences Engineering at the Physics Department, Al Azhar University-Gaza (AUG), Palestine and currently visiting Profossor at Condensed Matter Physics Laboratory (LPMC), UPJV-Amiens, France. Prof. AlDahoudi, born on August 28, 1969 in Gaza, and graduated with BSC in Physics from Birzeit University, West Bank in 1994 (honor listed). He was awarded the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) scholarships to get the MSc and PhD degrees in Physics. Prof. AlDahoudi spent more than 35 academic semesters teaching Physics and Materials Sciences courses for undergraduate and graduate students as well as supervising MSc and PhD dissertations. Among the honors and as outcomes of his distinguished achievements in Physics and Materials sciences, Prof. AlDahoudi got several prestigious postdoctoral scholarships including the Fulbright Visiting Scholar Fellowship of the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and the DAAD postdoctoral scholarship. Also, he won the First Prize (all over the Arab world) of the Federation of Arab Scientific Research Councils (FASRC) for 2014 distinguished research in Renewable Energy. The outstanding results of Prof. AlDahoudi research work have been presented at several national and international conferences and have also been published in several proceedings and reputational international scientific journals, some of them published as review articles on the subject.



Prof. AlDahoudi has conducted a new trend of research on several topics in Materials Sciences, like producing functional nanostructured thin film, solar cells for renewable energy applications, antimicrobial and gas sensing coatings, and glass shielding for medical applications. In addition, Prof. AlDahoudi got a research funds from Qatar Charity (QC), French Al Maqdisi Program, the German-Palestinian joint research program, and Qatar Red CrescentÂ Society (QRCS) to develop new functional nanomaterials in energy sectors, medical application and smart windows.



Prof. AlDahoudi is enthusiastic and very active for community related services and scientific issues, and he got the honor in organizing and co-organizing several international conferences, workshops and scientific days to address the interests and concerns of the community about the functional and safe application of nanoscience.
